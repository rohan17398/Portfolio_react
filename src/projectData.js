    description:
      "In the quest to combat climate change, I spearheaded the creation of the Carbon Footprint Tracker as part of my coursework in Object-Oriented Analysis and Design at Santa Clara University. This wasn't just a website; it was a beacon for over a thousand users, guiding them toward eco-friendlier choices with a suite of features including user authentication and profile management. But what made this tracker stand out was its ability to engage, to bring together a community united by a single cause: sustainable living.",

    title: "Air Quality Prediction using Regression Analysis",
    image: "/images/twitterClone.png",
    description:
      "With the tools of Machine Learning and the knowledge gained at Santa Clara University, I engineered a predictive model that could do more than crunch numbersâ€”it could forecast the future of our air quality with 90% accuracy. Delving into the depths of regression analysis, time-series analysis, and feature extraction, I fashioned a model that stood as a testament to the power of data in pollution management and the crucial foresight it can provide.",
